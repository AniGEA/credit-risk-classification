# credit-risk-classification

# Background 
This challenge involves using various machine learning techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The dataset contains historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, helping to identify which loans are likely to be healthy (class 0) and which are high-risk (class 1).


## Dataset Location



The dataset used in this analysis is stored in the Credit_Risk directory. The file is named [lending_data.csv](credit-risk-classification/Credit_Risk/lending_data.csv)

The dataset consists of a 77536-line CSV file.


##  Summary
The logistic regression model developed for this project performs exceptionally well in predicting loan outcomes:

* Healthy loans (class 0): 100% precision and 99% recall
* Risky loans (class 1): 85% precision and 91% recall
Overall, the model achieves a high accuracy of 99%.
