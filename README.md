# credit-risk-classification

The goal of this analysis is to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a loan is healthy (class 0) or high-risk (class 1). We will use logistic regression as our binary classifier. The analysis focuses on financial data, including loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. The aim is to classify the loan status as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1). 


* Background *
This challenge involves using various machine learning techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The dataset contains historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, helping to identify which loans are likely to be healthy (class 0) and which are high-risk (class 1).


*Dataset Location*

The dataset used in this analysis is stored in the Credit_Risk directory. The file is named lending_data.csv.

The dataset consists of a 77536-line CSV file.

*Summary* 

The logistic regression model developed for this project performs exceptionally well in predicting loan outcomes. It predicts healthy loans (class 0) with 100% precision and 99% recall. For risky loans (class 1), the model achieves 85% precision and 91% recall. Overall, the model demonstrates a high accuracy of 99%.



* Summary *
The logistic regression model developed for this project performs exceptionally well in predicting loan outcomes:

Healthy loans (class 0): 100% precision and 99% recall
Risky loans (class 1): 85% precision and 91% recall
Overall, the model achieves a high accuracy of 99%.
